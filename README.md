# Beer-Truck-Monitoring
Monitors and reports the temperature of individual cargo in the truck or trailer

This project uses a web front-end to configure temperature ranges for each type of cargo. It allows the user to view the current temperatures of the cargo.
The server periodically gets the temperature. It determines if the temperature is outside the configured range and then alerts the user.
